<p>There are different ways to organize your code.</p><p>The most basic approach is just to have command after command:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">engine = on
rotateWheels = true
...</pre><p>Then you could organize the code in functions,<em> functional programming</em>:</p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">start()
turnLeft()
drive()
turnRight()
stop()
...</pre><p>Another way is to organize your code in objects: <strong>Object Oriented Programming</strong></p><pre class="prettyprint linenums">robot1.start()
robot1.turnLeft()
robot1.drive()
robot1.turnRight()
robot1.stop()</pre><p>In this course we'll explain Object Oriented Programming (OOP). </p><p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask.</p>
