<h4>Copy and Reverse Solution</h4>

<p><code>copy_and_reverse</code>&nbsp; is very similar to the previous exercise, <code>copy</code>&nbsp;, except that we reverse the text using a slice before we write it to the new file:</p>





<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def copy_and_reverse(file_name, new_file_name):
    with open(file_name) as file:
        text = file.read()

    with open(new_file_name, "w") as new_file:
        new_file.write(text[::-1])</pre>
