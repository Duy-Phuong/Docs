<h4>Copy Solution</h4>

<p>Copy should copy contents from one file to another.&nbsp; For example, after running:<br></p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">copy('story.txt', 'story_copy.txt') # None
</pre>



<p>We would expect the contents of story.txt and story_copy.txt to now be the same.</p>

<p>Here's my solution:</p>



<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def copy(file_name, new_file_name):
    with open(file_name) as file:
        text = file.read()
    
    with open(new_file_name, "w") as new_file:
        new_file.write(text)</pre>
