<p>Here's the initial broken state of the function:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def count_dollar_signs(word):
    count = 0
    for char in word:
        if char == '$':
            count += 1
        return count</pre>





<p>The problem is that the function returns the very first time through the loop because of the way return is indented.</p>



<p>To fix it, all we have to do is<strong> outdent the return statement</strong> so that it now only returns after the loop finishes running</p>



<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def count_dollar_signs(word):
    count = 0
    for char in word:
        if char == '$':
            count += 1
    return count</pre>
