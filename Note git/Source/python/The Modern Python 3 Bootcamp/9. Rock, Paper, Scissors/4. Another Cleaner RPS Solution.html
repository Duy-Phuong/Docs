<h4>Another Cleaner RPS&nbsp;Solution</h4>

<p>Here's another potential solution that is much shorter.&nbsp; Rather than individually&nbsp;checking for the conditions that lead to a player2 win, they're all lumped together using the <code>else</code>&nbsp;:</p>



<p><br></p>



<pre class="prettyprint linenums">p1 = input("Player 1: rock, paper, or scissors ")
p2 = input("Player 2: rock, paper, or scissors ")
 
if p1 == p2:
    print("Draw")
elif p1 == "rock" and p2 == "scissors":
    print("p1 wins")
elif p1 == "paper" and p2 == "rock":
    print("p1 wins")
elif p1 == "scissors" and p2 == "paper":
    print("p1 wins")
else:
    print("p2 wins")</pre>





<p>The only issue with this version is that it will print&nbsp;"p2 wins" if either user enters an invalid move like "pizza".&nbsp; It doesn't have the error-checking of the previous solution detailed in the video.&nbsp; But as far as the pure RPS&nbsp;logic, this is a clean approach.</p>

<p>Thanks to Jasper for sharing his version of this solution.</p>
