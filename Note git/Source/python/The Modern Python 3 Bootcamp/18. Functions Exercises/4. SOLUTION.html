<p>Here's a solution that uses what we've learned so far.  </p>

<ul><li>Keep track of the days in a list.  </li><li>Check to make sure num isn't &lt; 0 or  &gt; 6.  </li><li>Return the corresponding day. Use days[num-1] because return_day(1) should return 0th item in list.</li></ul>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def return_day(num):
    days = ["Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"]
    # Check to see if num valid
    if num &gt; 0 and num &lt;= len(days):
        # use num - 1 because lists start at 0 
        return days[num-1]
    return None
</pre>









<p><strong>BONUS ADVANCED VERSION:</strong></p>

<p>Here's a more advanced solution that involves error handling, which we have not covered yet.  It eliminates the need to check to see if num is a valid index in the list. We cover this in the debugging section, but I thought you may want to see if now.</p>



<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def return_day(num):
    try:
        return ["Sunday","Monday", "Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"][num-1]
    except IndexError as e:
        return None</pre>
