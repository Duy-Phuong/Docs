<h4>Here's my solution:</h4>

<p>Remember, I don't need to write the <code>else </code>&nbsp;part of the conditional in this case, because I'm returning out of the function on the line before.&nbsp;So the only way the <code>return False</code>&nbsp; line runs is if the above line didn't run.&nbsp; It's an implicit <code>else</code>&nbsp;.</p>







<pre class="prettyprint linenums">def contains_purple(*args):
    if "purple" in args: return True
    return False</pre>
