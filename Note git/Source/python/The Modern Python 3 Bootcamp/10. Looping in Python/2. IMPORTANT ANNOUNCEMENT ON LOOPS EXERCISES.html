<h4>Hi Everyone! Thanks for not skipping this.</h4><p>This section is all about looping in Python. Unfortunately, there isn't an easy way for me to write code to test your loops. Once we learn things like lists, it will become much easier for me to write interactive exercises that rely on loops.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I've added tons of fun exercises, but most of them are <strong>video-based</strong> rather than interactive in the browser.&nbsp; &nbsp;It's just a technical limitation. In the Testing section later in this course, I explain why this is a tricky problem.</p><p>Thanks for your understanding!</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
